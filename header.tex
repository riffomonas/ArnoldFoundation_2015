% A note on fonts: As of 2013, NIH allows Georgia, Arial, Helvetica, and Palatino Linotype. LaTeX doesn't have Georgia or Arial built in; you can try to come up with your own solution if you wish to use those fonts. Here, Palatino & Helvetica are available, leave the font you want to use uncommented while commenting out the other one.
%\usepackage{palatino} % Palatino font
\usepackage{helvet} % Helvetica font
\renewcommand*\familydefault{\sfdefault} % Use the sans serif version of the font
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
%\linespread{1.05} % A little extra line spread is better for the Palatino font

\usepackage[none]{hyphenat}

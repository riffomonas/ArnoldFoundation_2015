First, we would develop instructional materials for workshops and autotutorials that would teach incoming researchers the best practices for insuring the reproducibility of their microbial ecology analyses. There are a large number of incoming researchers that have significant wetlab skills, but limited bioinformatics skills. Such a set of materials would be a vehicle for helping these researchers get quickly up to speed and improve the reproducibility of the science.

Second, we would create a community-supported reproducibility test of papers in the literature to determine whether another investigator can reproduce previously published results. The question wouldn’t be to identify fraud, rather to determine whether another person could follow the published methods to get what the initial investigators get. This would allow us to quantify the scope of any reproducibility problems we have in the field and the covariates that effect reproducibility. On a positive note, by enlisting the help of the community we would further the training goals of the first aim.

Finally, we would create a set of standardized methods that are well supported by the literature that would then be applied to the same papers in the second aim. In other words, can I take data from a researcher that used their favorite analysis pipeline and get their results if I use my pipeline? This would  assess the sensitivity of results to variation in analytical methods. This of course underlies the robustness of the science. This aim would also underscore the importance of reproducibility and the goals of the other aims.

I was happy to learn from Titus that the Arnold Foundation has a special interest in “Research Integrity” and was hoping that we might be able to have a conversation about a project I have been developing. I’m convinced that reproducible research is an important problem that needs to be measured and addressed, but at the same time not used as a rod to beat people with. I think the approach I’ve outlined above would address the problem through education and improving the science.
